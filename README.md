## For Students from GDI Introduction to HTML/CSS

Create a project directory (folder) on your computer. Then, create copies of the above files:  
+ index.html 
+ main.css 
+ normalize.css.

To copy the copy the files from above, just click their links and
copy/paste the contents into your corresponding files within your text
editor (most of you would have used sublime).
