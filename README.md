## For Students from GDI Introduction to HTML/CSS

To recreate the sample site reviewed in class, follow these steps:
+ Create a project directory (folder) on your computer to hold three files. 
+ Create three files that live within that project folder, named:  
  + index.html 
  + main.css 
  + normalize.css.
+ Now fill those three files with the appropriate content to
  render the sample site. To do so, click the link from above this README
  that matches the name of the corresponding file you created on your computer. Simply copy/paste the contents of each into your respective files.

Now, you can open the index.html file in your browser and see the sample
site.
